This package contains the Apache::TicketAccess module and the
Apache::TicketTool module.  These modules implement a cookie based
authentication system similar to the ticket access system described in the
mod_perl eagle book.

You need perl5.004 or better to install this package.  In addition, you should
also have the following packages installed:

   mod_perl 1.22 or later
   libapreq 0.31 or later  (for Apache::Request and Apache::Cookie)
   DBI
   Digest::MD5

   All of these modules are available from your favorite CPAN mirror.

If you plan to use this module under Apache::Filter, you need Apache::Filter
version 1.007 or later.  Earlier versions of Apache::Filter will not work
correctly with this module.   If you are not going to use this module with
Apache::Filter, you do not need to have Apache::Filter installed.

Installation of htis module is as usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
