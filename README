Apache::AuthCookie is Copyright (C) 2000-2009, Michael Schout.

WHAT IS THIS?

    This package contains the Apache::AuthTicket module and the
    Apache2::AuthTicket module.  These modules implement a cookie based
    authentication system similar to the ticket access system described in the
    mod_perl eagle book.

    Apache::AuthTicket is for mod_perl version 1
    Apache2::AuthTicket is for mod_perl version 2

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

    You need perl 5.6.0 or better to install this package.  In addition, you
    should also have the following packages installed:

        Apache::AuthCookie 2.011 or later.
        mod_perl 1.22 or later
        DBI
        Digest::MD5
        SQL::Abstract

    All of these modules are available from your favorite CPAN mirror.

    Installation of this module is as usual:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    Most of the tests are skipped unless you have DBD::SQLite and Apache::Test
    installed.  Install those modules from CPAN if you have trouble and want
    useful output from "make test"
