	* TicketAccess.pm:

		Split up the secret fetch into 2 queries to avoid the "LIMIT" clause.
		Sybase apparently does not support LIMIT, MySQL doesnt support subqueries,
		so this is the best we can do.

	* TicketAccess.pm:

		Changed cookine name to ${TicketRealm}_Ticket so that a single browser can
		be logged in to multiple realms simultaneously without clobbering the
		Ticket.
